First things to do after importing the project into Idea:

* "GOROOT is not defined" -> set GOROOT in _File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Go | GOROOT_
* enable Go modules in _File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Go | Go Modules_
* "Go support is disabled in module 'go-containers'" -> just click _Enable Go support_. It'll add:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<component name="Go" enabled="true" />
----
to `go-containers.iml`.

After adding typical structure and empty '*.go' files, in one of the files I put:

[source,go]
----
import (
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
----

Idea showed an error and `Alt-Enter` suggested `go get -t github.com/spf13/cobra`. `go.mod` didn't change, but:

* packages were downloaded to `$GOPATH/src`.
* ~/.cache/go-build was not affected
* `$GOPATH/pkg` was not affected

Trying to build `hello/main.go` (with `package main` and `main()` function) from root directory of the project:

----
10:04 $ go build
no Go files in /home/ggrzybek/sources/github.com/grgrzybek/go-containers

10:04 $ go build cmd/hello
package cmd/hello is not in GOROOT (/usr/lib/golang/src/cmd/hello)

10:04 $ go build -o bin/hello github.com/grgrzybek/go-containers/cmd/hello
cmd/hello/main.go:19:8: no required module provides package github.com/spf13/cobra; to add it:
	go get github.com/spf13/cobra
