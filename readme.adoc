= Containers/storage/images interaction using Go

This project contains Go commands/packages that use github.com/containers libraries.
The same libraries are used both by https://github.com/containers/podman[podman] and https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[cri-o].

== Observations

.Location of the configuration files

`github.com/containers/common/pkg/config` is a configuration related package. When used, I could print the expected:
----
11:54 $ bin/gggc common
Hello containers/common
Default containers configuration: /usr/share/containers/containers.conf
config.Path(): /home/ggrzybek/.config/containers/containers.conf

11:54 $ sudo bin/gggc common
Hello containers/common
Default containers configuration: /usr/share/containers/containers.conf
config.Path(): /etc/containers/containers.conf
----
